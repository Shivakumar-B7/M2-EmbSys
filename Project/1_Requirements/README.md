# 1. About The ELEVATOR SYSTEM

 ##  1.1 Description
   * An Elevator or Lift is a type of cable-assisted or roller-track assisted machine that vertically transports people between floors of building or other structure.
   They are typically powered by electronic motors that drive traction cables and counterweight systems such as a hoist, although some pump hydraulic fluid to raise a 
   cylindrical piston like a jack.

##  1.2 Identifying Features
  
  * Outside the elevators, buttons to go up or down.
  * Automatic door opening and closing shall be provided
  * Safety gates are attached to the elevator cab and will travel with the cab as it goes between floors.
  * Interlocks keep passengers from opening the elevator door while moving, so you never have to worry about opening a door before fully stopping at a floor.
  * The doors will remain locked until you reach a landing zone and will keep you safe, which is especially important with young, curious children or pets.
  * An emergency alarm will alert everyone close by that you need assistance and an emergency stop switch, or button, will stop the elevator altogether.
